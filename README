This is my solution to homework 1.01, Dungeon Generation.
It generates a "level" or "floor" that will eventually be one of many in a full Dungeon, complete with a random number of rooms with a random size (within the given constraints), cooridors connecting the rooms, and a small amount of up and down staircases.
Right now, the "randomness" of the level is seeded by time(), so the generated level is only going to be different every second.


To run the program, run the Makefile, and enter './rouge.o'. There are no arguments currently for this program.

Things to note:
	- The level is constrained to the defined size 21x80 (21 vertival units, 80 horizontal units), but a border is printed making the total output bigger than 21x80
	- A cell denoted as a Rock is printed as ' '
	- A cell denoted as a Room is printed as '.'
	- A cell denoted as a cooridor is printed as '#'
	- A cell denoted as a up staircase is printed as '<'
	- A cell denoted as a down staircase is printed as '>'
