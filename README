This is my solution to homework 1.05, User Interface with Ncurses.
It generates a random number of dungeons that are persistent as the pc moves up and down staircases. 
Individual dungeons in the whole "game state" are the same as previous assignments, save the first and last dungeon. In the first dungeon generated, there are only down staircases, because there are no dungeons above this level. Similarly for the last dungeon, there are no up staircases because it is the lowest level for the game.
For a player to win, they must traverse all levels in the game and kill all monsters (nearly impossible, rip).
The number of dungeons and npcs in those dungeons can be specified using the command arguments below,
See files "state.c", and "state.h" for this implentation. The majority of the game code happens in these files.
The print routines are located where what's being printed, i.e, the dungeon_draw in "dungeon.c" method get's called when drawing the dungeon to the screen after the PCs turn, which calls cell_draw in "cell.c" to draw a specific cell, which calls "character_draw" in "character.c" to draw a specific character when that cell contains a character. All these functions have been updated to utilize the ncurses, instead of using printf statements

Things to note:
	- A cell denoted as a Rock is printed as ' '
	- A cell denoted as a Room is printed as '.'
	- A cell denoted as a cooridor is printed as '#'
	- A cell denoted as a up staircase is printed as '<'
	- A cell denoted as a down staircase is printed as '>'
	- A cell containing the PC is printed as '@' with the color 'green' if the color option is selected
	- A cell containing an npc is printed as the type of that npc with the color 'red' if the color option is selected
	- The PC is controlled using the given assignement constraints
		- If, when moving diagonally, the pc can't move in both directions, it will move in the direction it can
	- Depending on the number of npcs defined, it can take a while for the next pc turn to take place
	- By far, the slowest part of each turn cycle is generating the shortest paths (non-tunneling and tunneling) to the pc after it moves. I'm not sure how best to make this faster using my priority queue implemtaiton in queue.c, queue.h, and path alrorithms in pathfinder.c, so any suggestions would be helpful.
		- So far, I've been relatively successful in using my own code without looking at the professors, so I'd like to solve this issue using what I have.

NPC type descriptions:
	- Type 0:
		- npc is unintelligent, non-telepathic, non-tunneling, and predictable
			it randomly selectes a direction and moves in a straight line in that direction until it meets a cell that's immutable or a wall
			at which point it thinks hard for a turn and picks a random direction and continues in a straight line
	- Type 1:
		- npc is intelligent, non-telepathic, non-tunneling, and predictable
			it wanders like npc_0 until it sees the pc, then takes the shortest, non-tunneling path to it
			if it cannot see the pc, and it has seen the pc already, it takes the shortest path to the pc's last known location
			after it reaches said location without seeing the player, it goes back to wandering
			it also intentionally avoids cells other npcs occupy as to not kill them
	- Type 2:
		- npc is unintelligent, telepathic, non-tunneling, and predictable
			it moves towards the player, not necessarily taking the shortest path, excluding immutable and wall cells
	- Type 3:
		- npc is intelligent, telepathic, non-tunneling, and predictable
			it moves towards the player constantly, always taking the shortest non-tunneling path
			it also intentionally avoids cells other npcs occupy as to not kill them
	- Type 4:
		- npc is unintelligent, non-telepathic, tunneling, and predictable
			it moves like npc_0, but it can tunnel through walls
			if left alone long enough, this npc will eventually make every cell not immutable and not a room a cooridor
	- Type 5:
		- npc is intelligent, non-telepathic, tunneling, and predictable
			it wanders like npc_3 until it sees the pc, then takes the shortest path to it
			if it cannot see the pc, and it has already seen the pc, it takes the shortest path to the pc's last known location
			after it reaches said location without seeing the player, it goes back to wandering
			it also intentionally avoids cells other npcs occupy as to not kill them
	- Type 6:
		- npc is unintelligent, telepathic, tunneling, and predictable
			it moves towards the player, not necessarily taking the shortest path, excluding immutable cells
			it always tries to bring the delta y and delta x between it and the player to 0; if both already are 0, it acts like a CASE_0 npc
	- Type 7:
		- npc is intelligent, telepathic, tunneling, and predictable
			it moves towards the player constantly, always taking the shortest path
			it also intentionally avoids cells other npcs occupy as to not kill them
	- Type 8:
		- npc is intelligent, non-telepathic, non-tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_0 npc, or randomly moving to a room/cooridor cell next to it
	- Type 9:
		- npc is unintelligent, telepathic, non-tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_1 npc, or randomly moving to a room/cooridor cell next to it
	- Type A:
		- npc is unintelligent, telepathic, non-tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_2 npc, or randomly moving to a room/cooridor cell next to it
	- Type B:
		- npc is intelligent, telepathic, non-tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_3 npc, or randomly moving to a room/cooridor cell next to it
	- Type C:
		- npc is unintelligent, non-telepathic, tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_4 npc, or randomly moving to any cell (besides immutable ones)
	- Type D:
		- npc is intelligent, non-telepathic, tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_5 npc, or randomly moving to any cell (besides immutable ones)
	- Type E:
		- npc is unintelligent, telepathic, tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% change of being a type_6 npc, or randomly moving to any cell (besides immutable ones)
	- Type F:
		- npc is intelligent, telepathic, tunneling, and eradic
			it has a 50% chance of being a type_7 npc, or randomly moving to any cell (besides immutable ones)

To run the program, run the Makefile, and enter './rouge.o'. The valid command arguments are defined as follows:
	It is assummed that an argument is precedded with a "--" and arguments have no such prefix. 
	A '|' means that the flags/arguments that are involved are never entered at the same time. Pick 1 flag/argument to enter
	Ignore '<>' characters when entering arguments in the command window:
	- Print dungeon mod:
		- flag: print | p
		- arguments: <b | f>
		- description: 
			- arg = <b>: Prints a dungeon border
			- arg = <f>: Rocks are printed as unicode blocks, increasing shade of block as hardness increases. Rooms and cooridors are printed as empty spaces to contrast filled in rocks
		- notes: 
		- default behavior: Printing follows required specification
		- example command: --border f
	- Load dungeon from file:
		- flag: load | l
		- arguments: <filepath>
		- description: 
			- <filepath> is undefined - loads a dungeon from a bit-file with the full path of "~/.rlg327/dungeon"
			- <filepath> is defined  - loads a dungeon from a bit-file at location <filepath>
		- notes: Bit-file must be in the format given in the assignment 1.02 requirements

	- Save dungeon to file:
		- flag: save | s
		- arguments: <filepath>
		- description: 
			- <filepath> is undefined - writes a generated dungeon to a bit-file
			- <filepath> is defined - writes a generated dungeon to a bit-file at location <filepath>
		- notes: Bit-file adhears to the assignment 1.02 requirements

		- default behavior: Nothing is printed with color
		- example command: --color
	- Print cell attributes:
		- flag: print-cell | pc
		- arguments: <h nt t c>
		- description:
			- <h>  is entered - A hardness map is printed after the base dungeon is printed. This will show all the hardness values of all the cells as a two-digit hex number. A row and column key is also displayed
			- <nt> is entered - A non-tunneling path map is printed after the base dungeon is printed. This shows the shortest path generated to the player from any connected cells in the dungeon for non-tunneling monsters
			- <t>  is entered - A tunneling path map is printed after the base dungeon is printed. This shows the shortest path generated to the player from any connected cells in the dungeon for tunneling monsters
			- <c>  is entered - A cost map is printed after the base dungeon is printed. This will show the cost to move from a given cell to any cell around it
		- notes: Arguments <nt> and <t> are automatically printed for assignment 1.03, maps are printed in the order <base> <nt> <t> <h> <c>
		- default behavior: No additional cell information is printed after dungeon generation. Only the base dungeon is printed
		- example command: --p-c h nt c
	- Number of npcs to generate per level
		- flag: nummon | nm
