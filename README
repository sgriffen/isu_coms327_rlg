This is my solution to homework 1.01, Dungeon Generation.
It generates a "level" or "floor" that will eventually be one of many in a full Dungeon, complete with a random number of rooms with a random size (within the given constraints), cooridors connecting the rooms, and a small amount of up and down staircases.
Right now, the "randomness" of the level is seeded by time(), so the generated level is only going to be different every second.

Things to note:
	- A cell denoted as a Rock is printed as ' '
	- A cell denoted as a Room is printed as '.'
	- A cell denoted as a cooridor is printed as '#'
	- A cell denoted as a up staircase is printed as '<'
	- A cell denoted as a down staircase is printed as '>'


To run the program, run the Makefile, and enter './rouge.o'. The valid command arguments are defined as follows:
	It is assummed that an argument is precedded with a "--" and arguments have no such prefix. 
	A '|' means that the arguments that are involved are never entered at the same time. Pick 1 argument to enter
	Ignore '<>' characters when entering arguments in the command window:
	- Level border:
			- flag: border
			- default behavior: no border is printed
			- arguments:
			- description: Print a border around the generated dungeon level
			- notes: Printing a border results in an output that exceedes the common terminal size of 80x21 (80 horizontal units, 21 vertical units), but the level generated is still constrained to the 80x21 requirement
			- example command: --border
			
A command to run this application with all arguments defined may look as follows:
	./rouge.o [--border]
