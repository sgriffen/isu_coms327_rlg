02/18/2021:
	- Turn in of final assignment 1.02 deaft
	- Updated README from saying "homework 1.01 solution" to "homework 1.02 solution"
	- Adding file writing function to read into multiple buffers
	- Re-working file writing utility function to use a custom struct to pass pass in nmemb, read size, and a void* write buffer instead of passing all of these seperatly
	- Adding file reading function to read into multiple buffers
	- Re-working file reading utility function to use a custom struct to pass in nmemb, read size, and a void* read buffer instead of passing all of these seperatly
	- Fixing known read bug with staircases
	- Accounting for endinness

02/17/2021:
	- Known bug: When loading staircases, sometimes down staircases get lost, not sure why
	- Updating README with new run command flag descriptions
	- Adding [--color] flag to toggle printing PC and NPCs in color
	- Changing [--border] flag to [--print] flag with arguments <b | f> to wither print the dungeon with a border (as before) or print the dungeon with rocks filled in and rooms/cooridors as empty spaces

02/16/2021:
	- Finilizing reading and writing dungeon to bitfile (ignorning endianness for now, using machine default)
	- Adding color printing: green is the PC, cyan is a staircase. Will add more later
	- Adding character struct to base PC and NPC off of
	- Creating function to read dungeon from bitfile

02/15/2021:
	- Creating function to write dungeon to bitfile
	- Printing PC and NPCs in color
	- Cleaning up code from previous assignment
		- typedefing structs and enums
		- adding correct cell hardness functionality (rooms and cooridors are hardness 0, dungeon border is hardness 255)
		- renaming Level struct and files to Dungeon
	- Renaming 
	- Updating ituls functions from yesterday

02/14/2021:
	- Putting all files except rouge.c and rouge.h into src directory. Putting util files unto src/utils directory
	- Adding file utils to read, write, and get file sizes (found in file_utils.c)
	- Renaming utils.c to math_utils.c and math_utils.hardness

02/11/2021:
	- Turn in of final assignment 1.01 draft
	- Updated README to explain how cooridor drawing works
	- Changed cooridor drawing algorithm to draw to closest room not already in set of connected rooms, instead of drawing a direct path to the room next in the array of rooms, regardless of if it's already connected
	
02/10/2021:
	- Initial submission of assignment 1.01
	- Cooridors now have a 25% chance of deviating (up, down, left, or right) from the shortest path to the next room
	- Changing staircase placement so that the "first" room in the level always has an "up" staircase, and the "last" room in the level always has a "down" staircase. Other staircases are randomly placed in the other rooms (if applicable)
	- Adding a random chance function to utils.c that outputs true or false if the random number generated is less than the inputted number, achieving a "% chance" effect

02/09/2021:
	- Adding "--border" command argument to toggle printing a border around the generated level
	- Updated README with program description, and a description of what is outputted
	- Room generation finalized
	- Base corridor generation working

02/08/2021:
	- Added staircases to rooms
	- Worked on different stratigies for generating cooridors, need to complete

02/07/2021:
	- Created base structs for Levels, Rooms, and Cells
	- Got random room generation working

02/03/2021: 
	- Started CHANGELOG
	- Created Makefile and README
