02/11/2021:
	- Turn in of final assignment 1.01 draft
	- Updated README to explain how cooridor drawing works
	- Changed cooridor drawing algorithm to draw to closest room not already in set of connected rooms, instead of drawing a direct path to the room next in the array of rooms, regardless of if it's already connected
	
02/10/2021:
	- Initial submission of assignment 1.01
	- Cooridors now have a 25% chance of deviating (up, down, left, or right) from the shortest path to the next room
	- Changing staircase placement so that the "first" room in the level always has an "up" staircase, and the "last" room in the level always has a "down" staircase. Other staircases are randomly placed in the other rooms (if applicable)
	- Adding a random chance function to utils.c that outputs true or false if the random number generated is less than the inputted number, achieving a "% chance" effect

02/09/2021:
	- Adding "--border" command argument to toggle printing a border around the generated level
	- Updated README with program description, and a description of what is outputted
	- Room generation finalized
	- Base corridor generation working

02/08/2021:
	- Added staircases to rooms
	- Worked on different stratigies for generating cooridors, need to complete

02/07/2021:
	- Created base structs for Levels, Rooms, and Cells
	- Got random room generation working

02/03/2021: 
	- Started CHANGELOG
	- Created Makefile and README
