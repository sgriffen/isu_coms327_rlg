02/24/2021:
	- Adding ability to define multiple print arguments on startup to print multiple versions of dungeons at once
	- Finalizing shortest path algorithm (implementation found in 'pathfinder.c' and 'pathfinder.h'. Priority queue implementation found in 'queue.c' and 'queue.h')
	- Replacing cell references in code (for rooms and PC for example) with a (y, x) coordinate reference
	- Replacing most of the 'malloc' calls with 'calloc'

02/23/2021:
	- Adding algorithm to find shortest path in 'pathfinder.c'. Currently not working, but code is there
	- Combining --load-from and --load run arguments into 1 argument and option pair. Doing same for --save-to and --save
	- Adding short-hand run argument versions for current long-form arguments (--l = --load, --s = --save, --p = --print)
	- Finilizing priority queue implementation and adding test executables to test certain utility functionality

02/22/2021:
	- Creation of queue.c and queue.h files to create a priority queue system for use in calculating the shortest path to the player

	- Adding file reading function to read into an array of buffers
	- Re-working file reading utility function to use a custom struct to pass in nmemb, read size, and a void* read buffer instead of passing all of these seperatly
	- Fixing known read bug with staircases
	- Accounting for endinness

02/17/2021:

	- Updating README with new run command flag descriptions
	- Adding [--color] flag to toggle printing PC and NPCs in color
	- Changing [--border] flag to [--print] flag with arguments <b | f> to wither print the dungeon with a border (as before) or print the dungeon with rocks filled in and rooms/cooridors as empty spaces

02/16/2021:
	- Finilizing reading and writing dungeon to bitfile (ignorning endianness for now, using machine default)

	- Renaming 
	- Updating ituls functions from yesterday

02/14/2021:
	- Putting all files except rouge.c and rouge.h into src directory. Putting util files unto src/utils directory

	- Renaming utils.c to math_utils.c and math_utils.hardness

02/11/2021:
	- Turn in of final assignment 1.01 draft
	- Updated README to explain how cooridor drawing works
	- Changed cooridor drawing algorithm to draw to closest room not already in set of connected rooms, instead of drawing a direct path to the room next in the array of rooms, regardless of if it's already connected
	
02/10/2021:
	- Initial submission of assignment 1.01
	- Cooridors now have a 25% chance of deviating (up, down, left, or right) from the shortest path to the next room
	- Changing staircase placement so that the "first" room in the level always has an "up" staircase, and the "last" room in the level always has a "down" staircase. Other staircases are randomly placed in the other rooms (if applicable)
	- Adding a random chance function to utils.c that outputs true or false if the random number generated is less than the inputted number, achieving a "% chance" effect

02/09/2021:
	- Adding "--border" command argument to toggle printing a border around the generated level
	- Updated README with program description, and a description of what is outputted
	- Room generation finalized
	- Base corridor generation working

	- Added staircases to rooms
	- Worked on different stratigies for generating cooridors, need to complete

02/07/2021:
	- Created base structs for Levels, Rooms, and Cells
	- Got random room generation working

02/03/2021: 
	- Started CHANGELOG
	- Created Makefile and README
